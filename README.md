What is blockchain?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><strong>Blockchain</strong> is a secure distributed ledger (data structure or database) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called “blocks”,  that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.</p><p>By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".</p><p>Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. </p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is blockchain?

What is blockchain transaction?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><strong>Transactions</strong> are the things that give a blockchain purpose. They are the smallest building blocks of a blockchain system. Transactions generally consist of:</p><ul><li>a recipient address, </li><li>a sender address, </li><li>and a value. </li></ul><p>This is not too different from a standard transaction that you would find on a credit card statement.</p><p>A transaction <em>changes the state</em> of the agreed-correct blockchain. A blockchain is a shared, decentralized, distributed state machine. This means that all nodes (users of the blockchain system) independently hold their own copy of the blockchain, and the current known "state" is calculated by processing each transaction in order as it appears in the blockchain.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/blockchain-architecture" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is blockchain transaction?

What is proof-of-work?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>A <strong>proof of work</strong> is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is proof-of-work?

Why does Blockchain need coins or tokens?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p><em>Tokens/Coins are used as a medium of exchange between the states</em>. They are digital assets built in to perform a specific function within a blockchain.</p><p>When someone does a transaction, there is a <em>change of state</em>, and coins are moved from one address to another address. Apart from that, transactions contain some additional data; this data can be mutated through the change of state. For this reason, blockchains need coins or tokens to incentivize the participants to join their networks.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://mindmajix.com/blockchain-interview-questions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Why does Blockchain need coins or tokens?

What is the blockchain data structure?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>Basically <strong>the blockchain data structure</strong> is explained as a back-linked record of blocks of transactions, which is ordered. It can be saved as a file or in a plain database. Each block can be recognized by a hash, created utilizing the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block mentions a former block, also identified as the parent block, in the “previous block hash” field, in the block header.</p><p></p><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div><p></p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://cryptoticker.io/en/blockchain-data-structure/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the blockchain data structure?

What is the purpose of a blockchain node?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>A blockchain exists out of blocks of data. These blocks of data are stored on nodes (compare it to small servers). <strong>Nodes</strong> can be any kind of device (mostly computers, laptops or even bigger servers). Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain. </p><p>All nodes on a blockchain are connected to each other and they constantly exchange the latest blockchain data with each other so all nodes stay up to date. They store, spread and preserve the blockchain data, so theoretically a blockchain exists on nodes. </p><p>A <strong>full node</strong> is basically a device (like a computer) that contains a full copy of the transaction history of the blockchain.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://lisk.io/academy/blockchain-basics/how-does-blockchain-work/nodes" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the purpose of a blockchain node?

What is the Genesis Block?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The <strong>first block in any blockchain </strong>is termed the <strong>genesis block</strong>. If you start at any block and follow the chain backwards chronologically, you will arrive at the genesis block. The genesis block is statically encoded within the client software, that it cannot be changed. Every node can identify the genesis block’s hash and structure, the fixed time of creation, and the single transactions within. Thus every node has a secure “root” from which is possible to build a trusted blockchain on.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-data-structure-ronald-chan" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the Genesis Block?

Explain the common structure of blockchains</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>Blockchains are composed of three core parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Block</strong>: A list of transactions recorded into a ledger over a given period. The size, period, and triggering event for blocks is different for every blockchain.</li><li><strong>Chain</strong>: A hash that links one block to another, mathematically “chaining” them together. </li><li><strong>Network</strong>: The network is composed of “full nodes.” Think of them as the computer running an algorithm that is securing the network. Each node contains a complete record of all the transactions that were ever recorded in that blockchain.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/the-structure-of-blockchains/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Explain the common structure of blockchains Interview Questions Source To Answer">dummies.com</a></span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div> <br><br></div><div data-v-5e9078c0="" class="unit"><div><h2>🔹 9. What is deterministic behavior?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>If A + B = C, then no matter what the circumstances, A+B will always be equal to C. That is called deterministic behavior.</p><p>Hash functions are deterministic, meaning A’s hash will always be H(A).</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-developer/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is deterministic behavior?
